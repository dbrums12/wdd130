      This project in web dev was very interesting. It really helped with
      bringing everything I learned with HTML together. It was like a big
      refresher for the whole course. I would find myself stuck a lot of times
      but then I would go back and remember the things I learned with White
      Water Rafting. I would either do that or I would use things like stack
      overflow to help figure out problems. Not to say everything went smooth
      sailing unfortunately some things I wasn’t able to figure out some. Some
      of the problems are figuring out grids, designing the project to make it
      look good, and being too over-ambitious.

      Looking back on the project, I think Grids gave me the most problems, and
      being unable to use them properly made things harder. Trying to get the
      boxes to fit in their right spot and moving things around was quite
      challenging. Thinking back on it would’ve made things a lot easier with
      positioning. I remember how I would d change one box to make the decisions
      better or change the style of a box and everything would shift over then I
      would have to spend the next couple of minutes figuring out how to get the
      box to shift back over into its original spot.

      Another thing that has made me worried about this project is the design. I
      never had an eye for design so making the project look good was a huge
      challenge for me. I did look up a bunch of mockup designs for websites
      which did help a lot. I also had a problem with finding the right image to
      put in the background. I wanted something that would contrast well with
      the foreground of the website but didn’t distract too much from the
      foreground, and that also had a space theme to it. I was very happy with
      the colors I chose for the project I think the red and blue went really
      well with each other and gave it a good NASA feel to it as well, which in
      the end was my ultimate inspiration for this website.

      When I started to make actual progress with my website, I noticed that I
      was being too ambitious with my ideas. I wanted to make a price counted
      for my website and have the user choose their own parts and see how much
      it all would cost but then I realized that I would have to put in a lot of
      Java Script, so I settle with just putting in information about the moon
      landings. I did put in little popups that would show the information that
      you wanted to know. I did the same thing with the Q&A that I put in, which
      was one of the original things that I wanted to keep in.

      I also had a problem with making sure the wireframe matches up with my end
      project. There were so many changes from the original design that I had to
      keep on going back to the original layout to change it and update it to
      what was happening on my actual website.

      It wasn’t all nothing but problems I had a lot of fun messing with the
      images to make them look better and it was fun seeing what looked good and
      what didn’t. Also, when I figured out how to put gifs into my website, I
      started to have a lot of fun with them. I even found a little space man
      dude that I put in. This was by far my favorite part not only was I able
      to do it but finding different gifs out on the web was also really cool.

      This whole experience made me really excited to see what more coding
      classes bring. I am excited to learn more coding languages to see the
      difference each brings. I am also interested to see how much deeper one
      can go with HTML. Overall I think this was a good introduction to computer
      programming and has definitely given me the confidence to continue coding
      and continue with my Computer Science Degree
